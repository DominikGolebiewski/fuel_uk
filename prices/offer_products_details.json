Prior to this new recipe, wheat beers were quite sour; that is, until the Hoegaarden monks started experimenting with orange peel and coriander from the colony Curaçao: a divine discovery that led to the world-famous Hoegaarden recipe and unique citrus flavor.Their creation was an inspired beer with a refreshing flavor and captivating aroma, unlike any in the world.You might call it divine inspiration... we call it Hoegaarden.Brewing Hoegaarden is no simple matter. Hoegaarden is fermented twice but isn't filtered, creating its cloudy appearance and smooth texture. The beer's taste is soft, light and slightly sweet and sour, accompanied by subtle citrus notes.Find us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and our own channels:www.hoegaarden.comwww.tapintoyourbeer.comFood Pairing Recommendation:Salad with citrus dressing, grilled white fish, prawns, goat cheese, ginger tofu, guacamole and sausage roll coleslaw. Wheat beers are one of the easiest beers to pair with a wide variety of foods just keep in mind they are low intensity so can easily be over-powered by very flavourful dishes. Mild shellfish work really well as do dishes that run with a wit's hint of lemon and spices.Indian food in particular with its complex interplay of spicing can be brilliantly complemented and bought to life by a witbier. The coriander seed and spicy notes from the beer can act in harmony with those notes often found in Indian cuisine, whilst the citrus notes from the beer can help brighten any dish.Home-Run Pairing: Steamed MusselsWitbier and steamed mussels is a classic, the mussels don't over power the beer and they complement each other in several ways. Firstly, the coriander and orange citrus notes serve as an extra seasoning for the dish. The beer's carbonation also helps refresh the palate between bites, whilst the mild acidity brightens up the mussels.

The cream locks in moisture to help better protect the skin against moisture loss, and to help restore and maintain the skin's moisture level.. MOISTURISING INGREDIENTS – Our Daily Cream contains light liquid paraffin that has emollient moisturising properties to help keep the skin hydrated. The perfume-free gentle formula is non-greasy and quickly absorbed and is even suitable for sensitive skin. The cream is easy to apply to skin and can be used whenever the skin feels dry, locking in moisture and leaving you with long-lasting softness in just 2 weeks.. DERMATOLOGICALLY TESTED – E45's formulation is dermatologically tested and does not contain any unnecessary colour or fragrances. It is suitable for everyday use on dry and sensitive skin for the whole family, including infants over the age of 1 month. You can apply the cream all over the body, including the face, for soft and supple skin. The cream has a low viscosity with watery consistency which can be thoroughly applied on the skin and is easily absorbed.. QUALITY SKINCARE EVERY DAY – For 60 years, E45 has been a skincare expert in dry and itchy skin and treatment for eczema, psoriasis, ichthyosis and other dry skin conditions. We understand the importance of quality everyday products that care for your skin with minimal fuss. The E45 range of products has been developed for different skin types and parts of the body and works hard to protect and maintain skin health.

We know of no brand produced by any other brewer which costs so much to brew and age.

Budweiser is a medium-bodied, flavorful, crisp American-style lager. Brewed with the best barley malt and a blend of premium hop varieties, it is an icon of core American values like optimism and celebration.Golden color with a subtle honey aroma and a trace of citrus, punctuated by notes of malt and noble hops. A perfectly balanced, full-flavoured lager with a crisp, clean and fast finish.Budweiser supports British farmers sourcing 75% of it's malted barley locally and aiming to reach 100% of British barley by 2020.Food Pairing:Complements rich, aromatic, spicy and smokey foods such as chili, BBQ ribs, grilled chicken and beef.With slightly more body and alcohol intensity than a light lager, Budweiser can stand up against a bit more flavour. However, it's most perfectly matched with medium/low intensity fatty and fried food that are a staple of most menus.Home-Run Pairing: Hamburger and ChipsThe American classic of Hamburger and chips are a match made in heaven for an ice cold American lager like Budweiser. Due to the fatty nature of this dish it can easily become stodgy and boring, however, Budweiser's high carbonation cleanses the palate after each bite.The slight grainy and bready notes pair nicely with a toasted burger bun, whilst the sweetness from the ketchup will be matched by the beers malts but kept in check by the slight bitterness.", "other_information": "1.4 UK Units per bottlePlease Drink ResponsiblyThe UK Chief Medical Officers recommend adults do not regularly drink more than 14 units per week.drinkaware.co.uk for the factsPlease RecycleNow Brewed with Renewable 100% ElectricityTo find out more about Budweiser's commitment to renewable electricity, please go to www.renewablefuture.com", "regulated_product_name": "Beer", "storage_type": "Ambient", "third_party_logo": "Mobius Loop.", "manufacturer_address": "Brewed by:AB InBev UK Limited,EC4A 1EN.", "return_to": "AB InBev UK Limited,EC4A 1EN.Consumer Helpline: 0800 65 560 75", "asda_product_information": "At ASDA, we do everything we can to make sure the information about the products we sell is\n        always as accurate as possible.

It is exceptional story-telling, which leaves the reader begging for the novel never to end. Grisham has sold more than 300 million copies of his work. This shows exactly why' DAILY MAILFor most of the last hundred years, Biloxi was known for its beaches, resorts, and seafood industry. But it had a darker side. It was also notorious for corruption and vice, everything from gambling, prostitution, bootleg liquor, drugs . . . even contract killings. The vice was controlled by a small cabal of mobsters, many of them rumoured to be members of the Dixie Mafia.Keith Rudy and Hugh Malco grew up in Biloxi in the sixties and were childhood friends. But as teenagers, their lives took them in different directions. Keith's father became a legendary prosecutor, determined to 'clean up the Coast.' Hugh's father became the 'Boss' of Biloxi's criminal underground. Keith went to law school and followed in his father's footsteps. Hugh preferred the nightlife and worked in his father's clubs. The two families were headed for a showdown, one that would happen in a courtroom.Rich with history and with a large cast of unforgettable characters, The Boys from Biloxi is a sweeping saga of two sons of immigrant families who grow up as friends, but ultimately find themselves in a knife-edge legal confrontation in which life itself hangs in the balance.In this novel, Grisham takes his powerful storytelling to the next level, his trademark twists and turns will keep you tearing through the pages until the stunning conclusion.'It's a story that spans half a century and ends inevitably in a courtroom showdown.

As skin gets drier, it feels and looks less healthy and becomes less effective at retaining moisture, which leaves it even more dry. Our cream soothes, protects, and restores very dry skin – it intensely replenishes moisture to sooth dryness and smooth out rough skin. The cream locks in moisture to help better protect the skin against moisture loss, and to help restore and maintain the skin's moisture level.. MOISTURISING INGREDIENTS – Our Daily Cream contains light liquid paraffin that has emollient moisturising properties to help keep the skin hydrated. The perfume-free gentle formula is non-greasy and quickly absorbed and is even suitable for sensitive skin. The cream is easy to apply to skin and can be used whenever the skin feels dry, locking in moisture and leaving you with long-lasting softness in just 2 weeks.. DERMATOLOGICALLY TESTED – E45's formulation is dermatologically tested and does not contain any unnecessary colour or fragrances. It is suitable for everyday use on dry and sensitive skin for the whole family, including infants over the age of 1 month. You can apply the cream all over the body, including the face, for soft and supple skin. The cream has a low viscosity with watery consistency which can be thoroughly applied on the skin and is easily absorbed.. QUALITY SKINCARE EVERY DAY – For 60 years, E45 has been a skincare expert in dry and itchy skin and treatment for eczema, psoriasis, ichthyosis and other dry skin conditions.

And Feyre must fight to break an ancient curse, or she will lose him forever. _________________________ Sarah J.

Marcus Rashford MBE is famous worldwide for his skills both on and off the pitch - but before he was a Manchester United and England footballer, and long before he started his inspiring campaign to end child food poverty, he was just an average kid from Wythenshawe, South Manchester. Now the nation's favourite footballer wants to show YOU how to achieve your dreams, in this positive and inspiring guide for life.Written with journalist Carl Anka, You Are a Champion is packed full of stories from Marcus's own life, brilliant advice and top-tips from performance psychologist Katie Warriner. It will show you how to be the very BEST that you can be.It shows kids how to:- Be comfortable with who you are - you can't be a champion until you're happy being you!- Dream big- Practise like a champion- Get out of your comfort zone and learn from your mistakes- Navigate adversity in a positive way- Find your team- Use your voice and stand up for others- Never stop learningWith an afterword by Tim S.

During the lockdown imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Marcus teamed up with the food distribution charity FareShare to cover the free school meal deficit for vulnerable children across the UK, raising in excess of 20 million pounds. Marcus successfully lobbied the British Government to u-turn policy around the free food voucher program - a campaign that has been deemed the quickest turnaround of Government policy in the history of British politics - so that 1.3 million vulnerable children continued to have access to food supplies whilst schools were closed during the pandemic.In response to Marcus's End Child Food Poverty campaign, the British Government committed GBP400 million to support vulnerable children across the UK, supporting 1.7 million children for the next 12 months.In October 2020, he was appointed MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours. Marcus has committed himself to combating child poverty in the UK and his book You Are a Champion is an inspiring guide for children about reaching their full potential.Carl Anka is a London-born journalist and broadcaster who likes his tea with milk and one sugar. He has written for BBC, Guardian, VICE, NME, GQ and BuzzFeed among other publications online and in print and specialises in writing about pop culture, video games, films and football. Currently a reporter for sports media group The Athletic, covering Manchester United, he is the host of the Talk of the Devils podcast and is scared of talking on the phone.Along with Marcus Rashford, Carl is the co-writer of You Are a Champion: How to Be the Best You Can Be - a positive and inspiring guide for life for young readers.", "asda_product_information": "At ASDA, we do everything we can to make sure the information about the products we sell is\n        always as accurate as possible.

Then, Glory Be! They were both diagnosed with heart disease and realised that time is short. They'd better spend it fishing...So they dusted off their kits, chucked on their waders and ventured into the achingly beautiful British countryside to fish, rediscover the joys of their friendship and ruminate on some of life's most profound questions, such as: How did we get so old? Where are all the fish? What are your favourite pocket meats? What should we do if we find a corpse?   Following the success of the BBC's Mortimer & Whitehouse: Gone Fishing series, this wonderful book by two lifelong friends is a love letter to the joys of angling, the thrill of the catch and the virtue of having a right daft laff with your mates.

Taking your taste buds on a delicious journey from the tasty hazelnut topping, through the smooth vanilla ice cream, down to the crunchy wafer cone – and of course, ending with the legendary chocolatey tip.An Italian ice cream manufacturer from Naples was passionate about ice cream, loving smooth texture, delicious flavours and great ingredients. One day, they found a way to spread their passion for ice cream to everyone. The great idea was to cover the inside of the cone with a chocolatey layer, allowing the wafer to keep its crispiness when filled with ice cream. From this breakthrough, we have the Cornetto we know and love today.Each pack contains six tasty ice cream cones that, whether enjoyed as a snack, tasty treat, or a dessert, are guaranteed to be a favourite with family and friends.Find us on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter and let us know your favourite flavour", "regulated_product_name": "Vanilla flavour ice cream in a wafer cone (12%), with chocolate flavour coating (13%) and hazelnut pieces (2.5%)", "storage_type": "Frozen", "manufacturer_address": "Unilever UK,Unilever House,Springfield Drive,Leatherhead,Surrey,KT22 7GR.Unilever Ireland Ltd,20 Riverwalk,National Digital Park,Citywest Business Campus,Dublin 24.", "return_to": "Unilever UK,Walls,Freepost ADM3940,London,SW1A 1YR.Unilever Ireland Ltd,20 Riverwalk,National Digital Park,Citywest Business Campus,Dublin 24.", "asda_product_information": "At ASDA, we do everything we can to make sure the information about the products we sell is\n        always as accurate as possible.

Sounds like a dream. At first, that's all it was. Long ago, we were making brownie ice cream sandwiches for sale in grocery stores. Sometimes there would be broken pieces in the brownie delivery, and we'd nab them for flavour experiments. What would brownie pieces taste like in chocolate ice cream? Pretty good, it turns out! That original experimental flavour eventually became the legendary ice cream concoction known as Chocolate Fudge Brownie. Meanwhile, Ben Cohen had met Bernie Glassman, the founder of Greyston Bakery, a Yonkers, New York, USA-based company with a mission to end poverty and give back to the community. Equally important, their brownies were just so darn good that after sampling some, Ben handwrote a note asking for two truckloads of brownie pieces. While we knew Greyston would be the ideal supplier for turning Chocolate Fudge Brownie into a flavour sold by the tub, getting the brownies to cooperate wasn't easy. After about 25 batches of brownies and six months of work, the flavour finally debuted in 1991, and it's been a hit frozen dessert ever since. We work with Fairtrade certified producers for cocoa, sugar and vanilla, and our Caring Dairy farmers produce the milk and cream sustainably. Greyston Bakery, one of the largest social enterprises in the USA, continues to provide the brownies for this and all of our flavours. All of Ben & Jerry's ice cream is made with free-range eggs, and we use responsibly sourced packaging. If you can't get enough of our ice cream, why not try our other flavours?

Citra has a fresh aromatic taste with hints of grapefruit, tropical fruit, and notes of citrus.The refermentation in the bottle and a long maturation, guarantees a pure character, delicate effervescence and a pleasant, sweet taste of alcohol. The aromatic Citra hop is grown in the Yakima Valley (USA). This third hop is added during the lagering process, which makes it a dry-hopped brew. The long maturation and qualitative craftmanship make this beer slow brewed to perfection.Food Recommendations:The fresh taste of the Citra goes well with salty sea flavours such as salmon, tuna, shrimp and mussels. If you don't like fish, matured cheese such as Red Leicester and cheddars also balance the Duvel Tripel Hop flavour. The citrus notes combine well with green vegetables such as broccoli, asparagus, and Brussel sprouts. Duvel Tripel hop Citra is best served at a temperature of 5°C. To bring out the full aromas, Duvel Tripel hop Citra should be poured at an angle of 45° in the iconic Tulip glass. The foam preferably starts in the middle of the red D and fills the glass, stopping at 1cm from the top.Anno 1871Duvel is being brewed by the fourth generation of the Moortgat family. Even though Duvel is a Belgian beer, the founder was inspired by English ales. Albert Moortgat himself selected a specific Scottish yeast strain, which is still used today. Duvel started experimenting with the third hop variety in 2007. Citra was the second version, which launched in 2012.

Its subtle bitterness, refined flavour and distinctive hop character make this natural beer stand out. Beer brewed with passion and dedicationThis blond speciality beer has been brewed in Puurs since 1923 under the name 'Duvel'. After a long refermentation and maturation, Duvel is ready to drink. The brewer uses his own breeding culture for brewing. The original yeast strain, selected by Albert Moortgat himself in the 1920s, originates from Scotland.After maturing in storage tanks, in which the beer is cooled down to around 0°C, it's is ready for bottling. Thanks to the addition of extra sugars and yeast, the beer ferments again in the bottle. This happens in warm cellars (24°C) and takes two weeks. Then the beer is moved to cold cellars, where it continues to mature and stabilize for another six weeks. This extra-long maturation period is unique and contributes to the refined flavour and pure taste of Duvel.Your taste buds will love thisThanks to its beautiful foam head, fine effervescence and silky smooth mouthfeel, Duvel and its 8,4% alcohol volume, stand out from other Belgian strong beers.Duvel 'THE ORIGINAL' is the reference among strong Belgian blond beers. The bouquet is spicy with some citrus, slightly leaning towards grapefruit due to the use of only the best hops. These characteristics can also be found in the taste. Thanks to the high amount of CO2, the beer has a delicious roundness in the mouth. A Duvel perfectly quenches your thirst, and it's the ideal aperitif as well.How to enjoy a Duvel?The beer is at its best at 5°C. During the pouring ritual, it's important to avoid contact between the bottle and the iconic tulip glass. Hold the dry glass at room temperature at an angle of 45° and slowly pour the beer up to the Duvel logo. Then gently turn the glass upright, while you continue to pour. When the Duvel is poured, a tornado of bubbles arises. This is because of the engraved “D” at the bottom of the glass that breaks down the CO2, which helps to maintain the foam longer. You can decide for yourself whether you pour the sediment into your glass or not. By doing so, the yeast creates a slightly bitter aftertaste and a cloudy appearance.Devilishly delicious combinations with DuvelThis strong Belgian blond beer goes perfectly with Flemish classics such as stew, steak, fries and asparagus. Other heavenly combinations include poultry, matured Comté cheese, hard cheese such as Damse brie and Passendale, and shellfish such as mussels, scampi and sushi.", "brand_marketing": "Duvel.

Pour the Colour Blend Formula (labelled 1) into the Colour Blend Activator (labelled 2) and close the cap. Close the applicator bottle and shake.Step 3. Apply Colour: Part out hair into small, even sections using the applicator tip. Apply colour first to your roots and stubborn greys. Work through hair from root to tip to ensure full saturation, but don't rub into the scalp. Pour any unused colour mixture down the drain as it will lose its effectiveness after an hour. If any colour gets on your skin, wipe it off with a damp towel.Step 4. Time it: Leave on for 25 minutes or the time indicated by your Strand Test. Tip: If your greys are really stubborn, it may be necessary to leave colour on for up to 45 minutes.Step 5. Rinse and Condition: Add a small amount of warm water and massage into a lather. Rinse until water runs clear. Apply the CC ColourSeal™ Conditioner to help lock in highlights and shine. For optimal colour results, leave on for 2 minutes, and then rinse thoroughly with warm water. Save remaining CC ColourSeal™ and continue to use once a week (after shampooing) in place of your usual conditioner for a total of 6 weeks.Important safety warnings - Read and follow instructions.

Marcus Rashford MBE is famous worldwide for his skills both on and off the pitch - but before he was a Manchester United and England footballer, and long before he started his inspiring campaign to end child food poverty, he was just an average kid from Wythenshawe, South Manchester. Now the nation's favourite footballer wants to show YOU how to achieve your dreams, in this positive and inspiring guide for life.Written with journalist Carl Anka, You Are a Champion is packed full of stories from Marcus's own life, brilliant advice and top-tips from performance psychologist Katie Warriner.

During the lockdown imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Marcus teamed up with the food distribution charity FareShare to cover the free school meal deficit for vulnerable children across the UK, raising in excess of 20 million pounds. Marcus successfully lobbied the British Government to u-turn policy around the free food voucher program - a campaign that has been deemed the quickest turnaround of Government policy in the history of British politics - so that 1.3 million vulnerable children continued to have access to food supplies whilst schools were closed during the pandemic.In response to Marcus's End Child Food Poverty campaign, the British Government committed GBP400 million to support vulnerable children across the UK, supporting 1.7 million children for the next 12 months.In October 2020, he was appointed MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours. Marcus has committed himself to combating child poverty in the UK and his book You Are a Champion is an inspiring guide for children about reaching their full potential.Carl Anka is a London-born journalist and broadcaster who likes his tea with milk and one sugar. He has written for BBC, Guardian, VICE, NME, GQ and BuzzFeed among other publications online and in print and specialises in writing about pop culture, video games, films and football. Currently a reporter for sports media group The Athletic, covering Manchester United, he is the host of the Talk of the Devils podcast and is scared of talking on the phone.Along with Marcus Rashford, Carl is the co-writer of You Are a Champion: How to Be the Best You Can Be - a positive and inspiring guide for life for young readers.", "asda_product_information": "At ASDA, we do everything we can to make sure the information about the products we sell is\n        always as accurate as possible.

Then, Glory Be! They were both diagnosed with heart disease and realised that time is short. They'd better spend it fishing...So they dusted off their kits, chucked on their waders and ventured into the achingly beautiful British countryside to fish, rediscover the joys of their friendship and ruminate on some of life's most profound questions, such as: How did we get so old? Where are all the fish? What are your favourite pocket meats? What should we do if we find a corpse?   Following the success of the BBC's Mortimer & Whitehouse: Gone Fishing series, this wonderful book by two lifelong friends is a love letter to the joys of angling, the thrill of the catch and the virtue of having a right daft laff with your mates.
